<h1>Idea of This Site</h1>
<h5>Feb 12, 2022</h5>
<p>Hi, In this post I am going to talk about the idea behind this site. So when I finished reading One Hundred Years of Solitude in January this year I was blown. It is such a wonderful book. It has a magin in itself and it is indeed a Magical Realism book. Marquez has really done a good job.</p>
  <p>So, after reading the book I was searching the internet for a wiki where I can learn more about the book and the story. I find such lack of good wiki sites that it motivated me to create a wiki for it. </p>
 <p>Currently, I am working on this site alone and also I am enrolled in a Masters degree program that's why I can't work on this site full time. But I will continue developing it. The basic structure of this site is ready and I can start putting details in it. Like the characters and incidents and other trivia. </p> 
 <p>I am so excited to do all this. If you want to help please <a href="https://twisthead.github.io/content/contact.html">contact me.</a></p>
