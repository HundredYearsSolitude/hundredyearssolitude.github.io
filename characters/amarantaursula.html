They make love numerous times Amaranta Ursula gets pregnant. Aureliano Jose Wants the child and names him Aureliano on his birth. Though the child did not survive. Also the child was born with the pig's tale, so the ancient fear of the Buendia Family (see <a href="../pages/trivia/trivia-pages/buendia-family.html#ursulas-fear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ursula's Fear</a>) comes to a reality.
