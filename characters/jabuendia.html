  <p>
    In his native place José Arcadio Buendía was a cock fighter. He was nearly one and a half years married to his first cousin <a href="ursula.html">Ursula</a>, but he hasn't have a child yet (because of Ursula's fear. <a href="https://hundredyearssolitude.github.io/pages/trivia/trivia-pages/buendia-family.html#ursulas-fear">read more</a> ). The people from village were saying that Ursula is still a virgin. José Arcadio Buendía did not like it. One day after he won a cockfight against <a href="prudencio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prudencio Aguilar</a> , Prudencio said tauntingly "Maybe that rooster of yours can do your wife a favor." José Arcadio Buendía became furious and challenged Prudencio Aguilar to a fight to death. José Arcadio Buendía brought his grandfather's spear and killed Prudencio Aguilar. After that day Ursula and Jose Arcadio started seeing ghost of Prudencio Aguilar in their house. So they decided to leave the village for a new place where the ghost will not haunt them. Some young men with their families and José Arcadio Buendía decided to cross the mountains, and thus they found Macondo.
