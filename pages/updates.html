Hello Visitor, The update is that I've made a page for every character, though the information about the characters is still need to be added. Also some side characters do not have their pages yet which I will add in coming days. I've started adding significant information of every character to their pages and I will add trivia and details as I'll suck more information out of the book. Also added some navigation bar in some pages and overhauled some pages. Bye, See You.

    Hi dear reader, Today I've successfully made the template for the character page of this site. Which looks like <a href="../characters/jabuendia.html">this</a>. Also I've done some minor improvments.</p>

    Please note that I am working on this site in my free time and a hobby project so I might not write much. If you want to help please <a href="https://twisthead.github.io">contact me</a>.</p>
