 Hello Visitor, Today I've added two new pages, the <a href="trivia/index.html">trivia page</a> you can find in the navigation tab on the home page. And, a simple <a href="howto.html">How-To</a> page has been placed in the bottom navigation menu. <a href="../characters/amarantaursula.html">Amaranta Ursula's</a> page has been completed good enough. I think. More work to be done. Good day!</p>

Hello Visitor, The site has been added with two pages you see them on the homepage on the right down of the navigation links. They contain a resources page and an image gallery page. These pages will explore further the possibilites of enhancing the knowledge of the book by additional means, like research papers, youtube videos and images. These resources will be immensely helpful to the college students, researchers and professors. More information will be added on regular basis. Thanks!</p>

Hello Visitor, The update is that I've made a page for every character, though the information about the characters is still need to be added. Also some side characters do not have their pages yet which I will add in coming days. I've started adding significant information of every character to their pages and I will add trivia and details as I'll suck more information out of the book. Also added some navigation bar in some pages and overhauled some pages. Bye, See You.

    Hi dear reader, Today I've successfully made the template for the character page of this site. Which looks like <a href="../characters/jabuendia.html">this</a>. Also I've done some minor improvments.</p>

    Please note that I am working on this site in my free time and a hobby project so I might not write much. If you want to help please <a href="https://twisthead.github.io">contact me</a>.</p>
